### `RShiny` application implementing **v**irtual **e**xperiment**s** for **t**eaching **e**xperimental **d**esign

Link to [vested here](https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/vested/)

Students are typically introduced to experimental design via textbook examples; statistical analysis is carried out on already collected, wrangled, and cleaned data. A virtual setting is a cost- and hassle-free way to emulate a real-world experiment. The [vested](https://cmjt.shinyapps.io/vested/) `Rshiny` application implements three virtual experiments: [Country Pumpkin](#country-pumpkin), [Chook eggsperiment](#chook-eggsperiment), and [Head Tomato](#head-tomato)

## The **Country Pumpkin** experiment


### Background given

Two farmers, Esther and Gwenllian, grow pumpkins in Pukekohe for the farmer's market. After several years, Esther clearly gets higher yields than Gwenllian. But why? Several factors—variety, heat, and light—differ in cultivation methods. Farmer Esther is conservative; she uses natural heating, ambient lighting, and a variety of pumpkin called Kumi Kumi, whilst Gwenllian uses supplementary heating, controlled lighting, and a variety called Buttercup. Can you design a **two-stage experiment** and, based on the results, decide which combination of the three factors of heat, light, and variety gives the highest pumpkin yield?

Due to funding cuts you only a small greenhouse to carry out this experiment. The greenhouse has six north facing plots (A–F) and six south facing (G–L). Your colleague tells you that from previous experiments in the greenhouse there is known to be a substantial difference in yields between the two sides of the greenhouse.

### Example questions to ask

 - What treatments do you plan to apply to each plot in the first-stage, and why?
 - How did the results from the first-stage inform your choices in the second?
 - Which combination, of heat, light, and variety, do you believe gives the maximal yield?

## The **Chook eggsperiment**


### Background given

You have been employed by the University's Poultry Research Farm to look into how pullets respond to the amount of copper added to basic diets of either wheat or maize You need to determine the optimum amount of copper to add to their diets to improve growth rate.

You are told that 150 units of copper added to either diet seems to improve growth. It is also known that there is a level of copper beyond which toxic effects will reduce growth rate. So what is the optimum amount to add?

At your disposal you have 32 cages that each contain 16 chicks. In addition to the amount of copper in their diet there are other factors that influence the growth rate of chicks (e.g., brooder, tier position within the hen house etc.).

### Example questions to ask

 - What quantity of copper must be added to a maize diet to give maximum growth rate?
 - What quantity of copper must be added to a wheat diet to give maximum growth rate?
 - What is the increase in growth rate obtained for a maize diet with the best quantity of copper compared with no copper?
 - What is the increase in growth rate obtained for a wheat diet with the best quantity of copper compared with no copper?
 - Which diet responds more to copper? (i.e., which diet gives the larger increase in growth rate when copper is added at its best level, compared with no added copper?)

## The **Head Tomato** experiment

### Background given

Your family owns a tomato farm, has done for generations. Yields are down, money's tight, and the farm is at risk of bankruptcy. There is however rumour of some fertilizer recipe handed down from your great-great-grandmother that will maximise the yield of tomatoes. The exact recipe has however been lost to the hands of time. You know the recipe involves horse manure, but what is the optimal amount? To save your family's farm you must find the optimal dose of fertiliser that produces the maximum
average biomass of tomatoes.

You should note that the greenhouse is bordered left and right with heating strips. In addition,
the greenhouse is lighted by artificial light: the floor pattern illustrates the light intensity pattern
that will be experienced by the plants. You are already aware that heat and light affect plant growth. Design an experiment
to find the optimal dose of manure in the fertiliser to maximise tomato yield. Your father
has given you twelve trays of twelve seedlings you can use in your experiment (you do not have to use them all). You have four different recipes to test

### Example questions to ask

 - How did you incorporate the three key principles of experimental design into your experiment?
 - What are the optimal conditions for tomato yield?
